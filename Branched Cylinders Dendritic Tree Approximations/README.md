# Branched Cylinders: Dendritic Tree Approximations

Welcome to the computer laboratory exploring the time-independent electrical properties of single-branched cables. This laboratory focuses on understanding the passive electrical characteristics of axonal and dendritic trees using the concept of branched cables. The simulations are limited to trees with only one order of branching, as illustrated in Figure 1. However, the principles discussed here can be extended to higher-order trees as well.

## Introduction

This computer laboratory aims to provide insights into the electrical behavior of branched cables, which are commonly used to model the electrical properties of neuronal structures like axons and dendrites. We will be utilizing MATLAB for simulation and analysis purposes to explore these properties.
