The aim of this was to explore some of the time independent electrical properties 
of single branched cables. Branched cables are an important means of modelling the passive electrical 
properties of axonal and dendritic trees. Consideration will be restricted to trees exhibiting only one 
order of branching (see Figure 1) however the principles elaborated upon here are easily extended to 
higher order trees.
