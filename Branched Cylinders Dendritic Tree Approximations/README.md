# Branched Cylinders: Dendritic Tree Approximations

The aim of this computer laboratory is to explore some of the time independent electrical properties 
ofsingle branched cables. Branched cables are an important means of modelling the passive electrical 
properties of axonal and dendritic trees. Consideration will be restricted to trees exhibiting only one 
order of branching. However the principles elaborated upon here are easily extended to 
higher order trees.
