## Introduction

Compartmental models provide a powerful approach to understanding complex physiological systems. This simulation focuses on analyzing two distinct types of compartmental models: glucose/insulin metabolism and iodine metabolism. By using MATLAB, we will simulate and study the responses of these models to various inputs and conditions.
