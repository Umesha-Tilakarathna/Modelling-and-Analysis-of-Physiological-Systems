# Investigation of Compartmental Systems

The assignments focus on the use of MATLAB and Simulink for investigating compartmental systems and physiological models.

## Overview

### Part 1
1. **Plasma Glucose/Insulin Model:**
   - Explore a simple plasma glucose/insulin model using MATLAB.
   - Simulate changes in insulin and glucose levels over a 4-hour period with a step input.
   - Modify the equations to model a bolus input and simulate diabetic subjects with and without insulin infusion.

2. **Riggs Model for Iodine Metabolism:**
   - Set up an m-file to represent the Riggs model and use ode23 to simulate responses.
   - Simulate thyroid diseases (Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism) and explore goitre and tumor simulations in the Riggs' model.

### Part 2
1. **Simulink Diagram:**
   - Utilize Simulink to represent a set of differential equations related to glucose and insulin.
   - Experiment with different coefficients and simulate the response to various inputs.

2. **Alternative Coefficients:**
   - Explore an alternative set of coefficients and observe the impact on simulation results.
   - Introduce changes in ùêµ(ùë°) for normal and diabetic subjects.

### Part 3
1. **Analytical Solution for Bolies' Glucose Model:**
   - Derive an analytical solution for the Bolies' glucose-insulin model.
   - Explain the stability curve and provide insights into the dynamics of glucose and insulin.

2. **Expanding Bolies' Model with Glucagon:**
   - Collaborate with the Anatomy and Physiology lecturer to understand the functionality of glucagon.
   - Propose and validate a compartmental model that incorporates the effects of glucagon on glucose and insulin levels.
