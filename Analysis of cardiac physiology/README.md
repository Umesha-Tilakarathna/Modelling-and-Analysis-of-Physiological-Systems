# Cardiac Physiological System Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of cardiac physiological systems using simulation software. The analysis focuses on various aspects of normal cardiac functioning and the effects of aortic valve stenosis. The simulation software provides visual representations of left ventricular pressure, left atrial pressure, aortic pressure, left ventricular volume, blood flow velocities in the aortic and mitral valves, and pressure-volume relations of the left ventricle.

## Introduction

This analysis involves using simulation software to explore and understand the physiological parameters and dynamics of the heart's functioning. The simulation provides graphical representations of key cardiac variables, allowing us to analyze phenomena such as valve opening and closing, blood flow patterns, pressure-volume relationships, and the effects of aortic valve stenosis.

### Simulation Software

The CircAdapt model enables simulation of blood pressures, volumes, and flows in heart and circulation on a beat-to-beat basis. Initially, this model was designed for teaching purposes, showing the importance of the physical laws of mechanics and fluid dynamics in understanding cardiovascular physiology. While designing the model, the developers have paid serious attention to the maintenance of the following properties:
- The model is easy to use
- The simulations are realistic
- The principles used are based on physics and physiology
- The number of parameters is limited
- Modification to pathology is easy

## Analysis Steps

1. **Normal Sinus Rhythm Analysis:**
   a. Determine aortic valve open and close points using the reference column and correlate them with left ventricular volume changes.
   b. Identify mitral valve open and close points using the reference column and correlate them with left ventricular volume changes.
   c. Mark points on the pressure-volume relation corresponding to valve opening and closing.
   d. Name the phases of the pressure-volume relation (isovolumic relaxation, ejection, filling, isovolumic contraction).
   e. Explain blood flow velocity patterns in the aortic and mitral valves.
   f. Analyze atrial pressure changes during the cardiac cycle and identify their causes.
   g. Identify E- and A-waves in the mitral blood flow velocity signal and calculate the E/A ratio.
   h. Calculate the E/A ratio for the simulation.
   i. Estimate passive and active filling contributions to left ventricular filling.
   j. Discuss the relationship between blood flow velocity (Vvalve) and flow rate (Qvalve).

2. **Aortic Valve Stenosis Analysis:**
   a. Define preload and afterload.
   b. Simulate aortic valve stenosis (AS) at various levels and evaluate hemodynamic changes, focusing on the left ventricular pressure-volume relation.
   c. Explain the impact of AS on preload, afterload, and cardiac output.
   d. Determine aortic blood pressure at maximal left ventricular pressure and calculate the pressure drop across the stenotic valve.
   e. Estimate the maximal pressure drop using the simplified Bernoulli equation and compare with actual measurement.
   f. Determine ejection duration from the blood flow velocity signal.
   g. Estimate the increase in external pump work due to 80% AS using the pressure-volume relation.
   h. Discuss myocardial tissue adaptation to increased pump work and its effect on afterload.
