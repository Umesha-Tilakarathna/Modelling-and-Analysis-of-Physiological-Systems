# Cardiac Physiological System Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of cardiac physiological systems using simulation software. The analysis focuses on various aspects of normal cardiac functioning and the effects of aortic valve stenosis. The simulation software provides visual representations of left ventricular pressure, left atrial pressure, aortic pressure, left ventricular volume, blood flow velocities in the aortic and mitral valves, and pressure-volume relations of the left ventricle.

This analysis involves using simulation software to explore and understand the physiological parameters and dynamics of the heart's functioning. The simulation provides graphical representations of key cardiac variables, allowing us to analyze phenomena such as valve opening and closing, blood flow patterns, pressure-volume relationships, and the effects of aortic valve stenosis.
