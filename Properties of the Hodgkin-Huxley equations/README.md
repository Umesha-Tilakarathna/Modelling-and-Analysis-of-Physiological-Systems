This aims to investigate some of the properties of the celebrated Hodgkin-Huxley 
equations. Experimentally in a space-clamped axon of finite length the regenerative electrical activity 
in response to some supra-threshold stimulus is called a membrane action potential as the whole 
axonal membrane simultaneously participates in the events underlying the action potential. Without 
the space clamp the action potential would propagate with finite velocity away from the site of suprathreshold stimulus application and would thus constitute a propagating action potential. This latter 
event is the one that would occur physiologically. Many of the properties of the propagating action 
potential are similar, if not identical, to the membrane action potential. The following four features of 
the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, all of which are observed physiologically, will be simulated in this 
assignment.

• Threshold
• Refractoriness - absolute and relative
• Repetitive activity
• Temperature dependence
