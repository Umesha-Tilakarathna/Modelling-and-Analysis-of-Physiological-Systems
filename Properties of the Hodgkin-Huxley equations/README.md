Welcome to the simulation focused on exploring the properties of the renowned Hodgkin-Huxley equations. This simulation delves into key aspects of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, investigating their behavior and characteristics. Specifically, we will explore the following four features that are observed physiologically:

1. Threshold
2. Refractoriness - Absolute and Relative
3. Repetitive Activity
4. Temperature Dependence

## Introduction

The Hodgkin-Huxley equations provide a fundamental understanding of how neurons generate and propagate action potentials. This simulation will enable us to observe and analyze these properties, shedding light on how neurons respond to electrical stimulation.

- **MATLAB:** The simulation and analysis are conducted using MATLAB.
- **Parameters:** We will use the parameters and values originally presented by Hodgkin and Huxley for the squid giant axon.

## Simulation Steps

### 1. Threshold
- Explore the concept of threshold by applying sub-threshold and supra-threshold current pulses.
- Observe the behavior of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations in response to different current amplitudes.

### 2. Refractoriness
- Investigate absolute and relative refractory periods.
- Study the relationship between consecutive action potentials and stimulus amplitudes.

### 3. Repetitive Activity
- Examine repetitive activity by eliciting multiple action potentials with long duration supra-threshold currents.
- Determine the threshold for repetitive activity as a function of the inter-stimulus interval.

### 4. Temperature Dependence
- Observe the effects of different temperatures on the duration and amplitude of action potentials.
- Analyze how temperature influences various features of the action potential.
