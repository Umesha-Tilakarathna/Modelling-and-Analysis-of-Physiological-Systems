# Modelling-and-Analysis-of-Physiological-Systems

Through this module, we were able to delve into the intricate intersection of engineering principles and biological systems. Through this we were able to develop a comprehensive understanding of physiological models and computational techniques. The aim was to interpret biological systems through an engineering lens, equipping students with the ability to construct computational models for in-depth analysis. The curriculum covered fundamental principles of mathematical modelling, biomechanics of musculoskeletal systems, respiratory system modelling, circulatory system models, electrophysiology of biological conductors, and compartmental modelling. Each segment targets specific learning outcomes, fostering skills to analyze and address physiological limitations within diverse biological systems.
