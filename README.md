Explore the intricacies of the heart's behavior using simulation software. Analyze normal sinus rhythm, blood flow velocities, pressure-volume relations, and more. Investigate the opening and closing of valves, diastolic filling phases, and flow patterns. Utilize simulation data to understand the physiological processes during the cardiac cycle.

### 2. Branched Cylinders: Dendritic Tree Approximation
![Branced cylinders](https://github.com/RavinduMPK/Modelling-and-Analysis-of-Physiological-Systems/assets/68577937/070e0352-f981-475b-a9bf-d38abe874ffd)

Investigate the electrical properties of single-branched cables, focusing on dendritic tree approximations. Explore the behavior of axonal and dendritic trees using MATLAB simulations. Understand the principles of these branched systems and their implications for physiological signaling.

### 3. Hodgkin-Huxley Equation
![Hodgkin-Huxley](https://github.com/RavinduMPK/Modelling-and-Analysis-of-Physiological-Systems/assets/68577937/e3732cc6-2d7c-46bc-b63b-2db50e5bcf30)

Dive into the Hodgkin-Huxley equations to study the properties of action potentials in nerve cells. Analyze threshold behavior, refractoriness, repetitive activity, and temperature dependence of these equations. Use MATLAB to simulate and visualize the behavior of action potentials under different conditions.

### 4. Investigating Compartmental Systems
![Compartmental modelling](https://github.com/RavinduMPK/Modelling-and-Analysis-of-Physiological-Systems/assets/68577937/d6d1dd8a-44dc-4eba-afe8-ea6cd2b83eb1)

Study compartmental systems using first-order differential equations. Explore glucose/insulin and iodine metabolism models. Investigate responses to various inputs, thyroid diseases, and temperature dependence. Use both MATLAB and Simulink to simulate and analyze these complex systems.

### 5. Simulation of Respiratory Mechanism
