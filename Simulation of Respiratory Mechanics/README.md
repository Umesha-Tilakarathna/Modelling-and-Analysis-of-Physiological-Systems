# Simulation of Respiratory Mechanics Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of respiratory mechanics simulation using a tool developed by David Leonardo Rodriguez Sarmiento and Daniela Acevedo Guerrero (2020). The simulation enables the study of various respiratory conditions in adults, including normal, restrictive pulmonary disease, and obstructive pulmonary disease scenarios. The simulator provides graphical representations of ventilation patterns and allows for a comparison of minute ventilation across different ventilator settings.

## Introduction

This analysis focuses on using the simulation tool to explore respiratory mechanics in different conditions. By simulating normal and diseased respiratory scenarios, we aim to understand the impact of various pulmonary conditions on minute ventilation and ventilation patterns.

The simulation tool used in this analysis is a GUI-based application developed on Simulink. The tool allows users to simulate respiratory mechanics under different conditions and provides visualizations of ventilation patterns and minute ventilation. The simulator is designed to help users comprehend how respiratory mechanics change in response to different scenarios.
The simulator was developed by David Leonardo Rodriguez Sarmiento and Daniela Acevedo Guerrero (2020).
