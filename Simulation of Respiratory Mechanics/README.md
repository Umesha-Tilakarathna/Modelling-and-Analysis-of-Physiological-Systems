Used the simulator developed by David Leonardo Rodriguez Sarmiento and Daniela Acevedo Guerrero (2020) available at Simulation of Respiratory Mechanics on Simulink with GUI (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/75335-simulation-of-respiratory-mechanics-on-simulink-with-gui), MATLAB Central File Exchange to simulate the following conditions of an adult:

1. Normal

2. With a restrictive pulmonary disease

3. With an obstructive pulmonary disease

Report contains graphs to show the ventilation and discussions on the differences in minute ventilation for the same setting of the ventilator.
